Artifacts like: subsets, data aggregates, plots, statistical models, different versions of data sets and different versions of results. The more projects we work with the more artifacts are produced and the harder it is to manage these artifacts.\r\n\r\nArchivist helps to store and manage artifacts created in R.\r\n![Overview of archivist package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbiecek/archivist/master/archiwum.png)\r\n\r\nArchivist allows you to store selected artifacts as binary files together with their metadata and relations. Archivist allows you to share artifacts with others, either through a shared folder or github. Archivist allows you to look for already created artifacts by using its class, name, date of creation or other properties. It also facilitates restoring such artifacts. Archivist allows to check if a new artifact is the exact copy of the one that was produced some time ago. This might be useful either for testing or caching.\r\n\r\nArchivist is a set of tools for datasets and plots archiving.\r\n\r\nFor more information see:\r\n- [Tags](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/wiki/archivist-package---Tags),\r\n- [Repository](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/wiki/archivist-package-Repository),\r\n- [md5hash](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/wiki/archivist-package-md5hash).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject is supported by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/).\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4> The list of use-cases: </h4>\r\n- <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/pbiecek/archivist/master/vignettes/cacheUseCase.html\">Cache with the archivist package</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/pbiecek/archivist/master/vignettes/accessibilityUseCase.html\">Retrieving all plots with other github repository (example with flights data from Hadley Wickham useR!2014 tutorial)</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/pbiecek/archivist/master/vignettes/chainingUseCase.html\">Archiving artifacts with their chaining code</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/pbiecek/archivist/master/vignettes/justGetIT.html\">Just get the object</a>\r\n- [Lazy load with **archivist**](https://rawgit.com/pbiecek/archivist/master/vignettes/lazyLoadUseCase.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5> Installing archivist package: </h5>\r\nTo get started, install the latest version of **archivist** from CRAN:\r\n```{Ruby}\r\ninstall.packages(\"archivist\")\r\n```\r\nor use:\r\n```{Ruby}\r\nif (!require(devtools)) {\r\n    install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n    require(devtools)\r\n}\r\ninstall_github(\"pbiecek/archivist\")\r\n```\r\nMake sure you have [rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed on your computer.\r\n\r\n<h5> The list of available functions: </h5>\r\n```{Ruby}\r\nhelp(package=\"archivist\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n<h5> Authors of the project: </h5>\r\n> Przemysław Biecek, przemyslaw.biecek@gmail.com\r\n>\r\n> Marcin Kosiński, m.p.kosinski@gmail.com","google":"UA-55072490-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
