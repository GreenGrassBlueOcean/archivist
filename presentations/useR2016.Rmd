# What and why?

## Everything in R is an object

<br/>

*What if* we store all R objects that have been ever created? 

<br/>

Goals for the [archivist](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/) package:

* keep trace of (every) created object, 
* keep trace of relations between objects, 
* keep meta-information/properties of objects,
* provide a way to seek objects that match some conditions,
* provide a way to restore specific objects.

## What the archivist is doing?

<br/>

The [archivist](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/) is an R package for management of R objects outside R session. It stores binary copies of R objects in rda files and provides easy access for seeking and restoring these objects based on timestamps, classes or other properties

<br/>

But, why anybody would like to store copies of all R objects?

## Example 1: archivist + knitr

Enrich knitr reports with hooks for selected objects. [Example](https://rawgithub.com/pbiecek/Eseje/master/GrammarOfGraphics.html).

>archivist::aread("pbiecek/Eseje/arepo/e10f9d223df408fca73ea548456493f4")
</small>

## Example 2: archivist + shiny

Enrich shiny applications with hooks to displayed plots. [Example](http://mi2.mini.pw.edu.pl:8080/archivist/).

# How does it work? 

## Basics

* Artifacts are stored in repositories. 
* Use [createLocalRepo()](http://search.r-project.org/library/archivist/html/createEmptyRepo.html) to initialize a new repo. 
* Add new artifacts with [saveToLocalRepo()](http://search.r-project.org/library/archivist/html/saveToRepo.html).
* Artifacts are identified by their md5hash.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(archivist)

createLocalRepo("arepo", default = TRUE)

model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length + Species, data=iris)
saveToLocalRepo(model)

library(ggplot2)

plot <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length)) + geom_point()
saveToLocalRepo(plot)
```

## 

* Use [aread()](http://search.r-project.org/library/archivist/html/aread.html) to read an artifact from a repository to an R session. 
* You can read artifacts either from local folders or remote  repositories.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# from the default local repository
aread("e700c6704890022a4e0277e11cd46488")

# from the github pbiecek/graphGallery repository
aread("pbiecek/graphGallery/18a98048f0584469483afb65294ce3ed")
```

## 

* Use [asearch()](http://search.r-project.org/library/archivist/html/asearch.html) to seek for all artifacts with properties that fit some patterns.
* As a result you will get a list of R objects.
* You may use time intervals as patters as well.
* Below we ask for all `lm` models that are in a repository, apply BIC criteria and sort models.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
models <- asearch("pbiecek/graphGallery", patterns = "class:lm")
modelsBIC <- sapply(models, BIC)
sort(modelsBIC)
```

## The structure

- Repository is a folder with:
* a subfolder `gallery` with `rda` dumps of recorded objects,
* an SQLite database (file `backpack.db`).

- The database contains two tables, with artifacts and their properties and relations.

<img align="right" width="500" src="http://biecek.pl/archivist/archivistERD.jpg">

## 

* Properties and relations are stored as Tags.
* Tags are being extracted from an artifact after each call to [saveToLocalRepo()](http://search.r-project.org/library/archivist/html/saveToRepo.html).
* Use [showLocalRepo()](http://search.r-project.org/library/archivist/html/showLocalRepo.html) to examine tags for selected artifacts.
* Popular and useful tags are: `format:...`, `name:...`, `class:...`, `date:...`.

<img width="900" src="http://biecek.pl/archivist/tags2.png">

## 

* Different tags are extracted from different objects. 
* The list is flexible, one may easily add new tags if needed.

# What else you can do with the [archivist](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/)?

## Pedigree of an object

* Use [%a%](http://search.r-project.org/library/archivist/html/ahistory.html) operator to record function calls. 
* Use [ahistory()](http://search.r-project.org/library/archivist/html/ahistory.html) to present the pedigree of an object. 
* All partial intermediate results are also stored in a repo 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
iris %a%
 dplyr::filter(Sepal.Length < 6) %a%
 lm(Petal.Length~Species, data=.) %a%
 summary() -> tmp
```
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
ahistory(md5hash = "050e41ec3bc40b3004bc6bdd356acae7", format = "kable", alink = TRUE)
```
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ahistory(tmp)
```

## <small> You need a village to raise an R object</small>

* For some artifacts you need specific versions of packages (see `ggplot2`).
* For every object also the `sessionInfo` is stored.
* Use [asession](http://search.r-project.org/library/archivist/html/asession.html) to check versions of packages loaded when artifact was added to the repo.
* Use [restoreLibs](http://search.r-project.org/library/archivist/html/restoreLibs.html) to install packages in versions installed when artifact was added to the repo. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
asession("050e41ec3bc40b3004bc6bdd356acae7")
# restoreLibs("pbiecek/graphGallery/arepo/600bda83cb840947976bd1ce3a11879d")
```

## Other features

* Deeper integration with GitHub is available in [archivist.github](http://r-bloggers.com/r-hero-saves-backup-city-with-archivist-and-github/) thanks to `@MarcinKosinski` (coauthor of the archivist).
* Use [trace()](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/trace.html) to force adding an artifact to repo after each call of a specific function. 
* The code below will adds all results of [lm()](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/lm.html) to the repository `allModels`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
createLocalRepo("allModels", default = TRUE)
trace(lm, exit = quote(saveToLocalRepo(z, repoDir="allModels")))
```

* Use [addHooksToPrint()](http://search.r-project.org/library/archivist/html/addHooksToPrint.html) to add archivist hooks to all objects of selected classes in a knitr report.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
addHooksToPrint(class=c("ggplot", "data.frame"),
  repoDir = "arepo",
  repo = "Eseje", user = "pbiecek", subdir = "arepo")
```
