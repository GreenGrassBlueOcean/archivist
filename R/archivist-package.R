#' @description
#' Data exploration and modeling is a proces in which a lot of data artifacts are produced. 
#' Artifacts like: subsets, data aggregates, plots, statistical models, different
#' versions of data sets and different versions of results. 
#' The more projects we work with the more artifacts are produced and the harder it is to manage these artifacts. 
#' 
#' Archivist helps to store and manage artifacts created in R.
#' 
#' Archivist allows you to store selected artifacts as a binary files
#'   together with their metadata and relations.
#' Archivist allows to share artifacts with others, either through shared folder or github.
#' Archivist allows to look for already created artifacts by using it's class, 
#'   name, date of the creation or other properties.
#' Makes it easy to restore such artifacts.
#' Archivist allows to check if new artifact is the exact 
#'   copy that was produced some time ago.
#'   That might be usefull either for testing or caching.
